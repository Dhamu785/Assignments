## Basic Question
#### Beginner Level - Linear Regression
- Task: Given a dataset containing information about houses (e.g., size, number of bedrooms,
neighbourhood), ask candidates to build a linear regression model to predict house prices.
- Dataset: You can use a dataset like the Boston Housing Prices dataset available in ScikitLearn or a similar one from Kaggle.
- Evaluation: Assess their ability to pre-process data, create a linear regression model, and
evaluate its performance.

#### Answer
- House prediction dataset from Kaggle is used for this task.
- The data and model file is attached to the folder [Basics](https://github.com/Dhamu785/Assignments/tree/main/Basic)

## Intermediate Question
#### Intermediate Level - Natural Language Processing (NLP)
- Task: Provide candidates with a dataset of customer reviews (e.g., Amazon product reviews)
and ask them to perform sentiment analysis using NLP techniques.
- Dataset: You can use the IMDb Movie Reviews dataset or another publicly available NLP
dataset.
- Evaluation: Evaluate their ability to perform text pre-processing, build a sentiment analysis
model (e.g., using a pre-trained transformer model like BERT), and report the results.

#### Answer
- IMDB dataset from kaggle is used.
- Pre trained BERT model from hugging face is used for the task.
- The train.csv is greater then 25MB. So, I can't able to upload the file.

## Advanced Question
#### Advanced Level - Computer Vision
- Task: Present candidates with a dataset of images (e.g., CIFAR-10 or MNIST) and ask them to
build a deep learning model (e.g., CNN) to classify the images into predefined categories.
- Dataset: You can use standard datasets like CIFAR-10, MNIST, or any relevant dataset.
- Evaluation: Assess their ability to work with image data, design and train a convolutional
neural network, and evaluate its performance.

#### Answer
- The dataset used here is mnist dataset(Hand written digits) from tensorflow.
- CNN architecture is used for the model training.
- The model is saved and for further predictions.

Thank you.
